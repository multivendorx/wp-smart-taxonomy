A cool new Wordpress plugin that helps you to make smart collection of posts.

== Description ==
The plugin provides an easy way to automatically assign your posts to relevant categories. The plugin looks up your post title and tags, matches the key words with already available categories and automatically assigns the post to those relevant categories. 

This plugin will be really helpful if your website has a huge number of post and post categories. The plugin minimizes the effort of manually assigning each and every post to relevant categories. 

For example, if you create a post with a title "IPhone 5S Reviews" and you have categories like "IPhone", "Reviews" available, then the post gets automatically assigned to these categories.

= Compatibility =
The plugin is fully compatible with the recent versions of WordPress.

* Compatible with older WordPress versions, down to 3.0.
* Multilingual Support is included with the plugin and is fully compatible with WPML.

= Configurable =
WP Smart taxonomy is completely customizable. Among others, you may enable/disable smart category(ies), append with existing categories, choose whether to generate smart category associations from post titles and tags.

From version 1.0.3 onwards, the settings can be overriden for individual posts.

= Upcoming Features =
The plugin now only works with default Wordpress posts and taxonomies. 
In the upcoming version we will be adding support for custom post types and taxonomies. So, keep a look out for the updated version. :)
